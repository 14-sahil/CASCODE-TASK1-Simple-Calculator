# Simple Calculator

In this repository, I have created a simple calculator application written in Java, which performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator has a user-friendly interface, where the user can enter two numbers and select the operation to be performed. After performing the operation, the result is displayed on the screen.

This project can be easily customized and extended to include additional functionality or to incorporate more complex mathematical operations. Additionally, it can be used as a learning tool for those who are new to Java programming, as the code is well-documented and easy to follow.
